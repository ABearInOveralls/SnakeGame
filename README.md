# Snake Game

A simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's `turtle` module.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake:
  - **Up Arrow**: Move the snake up
  - **Down Arrow**: Move the snake down
  - **Left Arrow**: Move the snake left
  - **Right Arrow**: Move the snake right
- The objective is to eat the blue food that appears randomly on the screen.
- Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and your score increases.
- The game ends if:
  - The snake hits the wall.
  - The snake collides with its own body.

## Features

- Dynamic snake movement
- Randomly placed food
